## Chatbot
This is a chatbot that can talk to you and is very simple to learn for a beginner.

### Getting Started
This is a very easy to execute program. You just need to save both the files in a single folder. Download the required libraries and you are ready to go.

### Prerequisites
1. Install nltk
2. Download all nltk packages
3. Install numpy library
4. Install sklearn

### Running the tests
I am going to brief you on how this works.
1. There is a separate function for the greetings and bye(s).
2. For these fuctions we first lemmatize the sentences and remove all the stopwords plus punctuations.
3. The other responses are generated using Tf-idf vectorizer which basically gives a score to your sentences.
4. The whole chatbot was possible with just this. But I thought to make it more informative and so included these different functions.

#### Hopefully this will help you get started with chatbots :)
